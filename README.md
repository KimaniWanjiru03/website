•Mpesa Till Mapping Audits for KBL distributors. To ensure that distributors deposit
what is required of them to KBL in order to keep the process flowing efficiently.
•Profit and loss statement. Following the rules, distributors should have specific
percentage ranges of their expenses, gross profit, and net profit to monitor their
profitability. The role entailed breaking down the various expenditures so that
KBL and the Distributor could understand how their revenue flows down to their
net profit and what they needed to do to achieve maximum profitability.

## Projects
05/2023 – 06/2023 Benefits of Inclusive Insurance
A Case Study of the Low-Income Population in Kenya
This thesis explores the impact of insurance on the low-income population in
Kenya, focusing on the change in capital as a measure of benefits. The study
employed an absorbing Markov chain analysis using collected data, revealing that
insurance did not demonstrate significant benefits for the specific sample of
individuals due to data imbalance. Additionally, a machine learning approach was
adopted to predict an individual's insurance status based on demographic
characteristics. Decision trees, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest models
were employed, with the Random Forest model yielding the best results. The key
variables influencing insurance status prediction were found to be education level,
motive, income range, and the number of dependents. This thesis contributes
valuable insights into the efficacy of inclusive insurance and the determinants of
insurance status among the low-income population in Kenya.

05/2021 – 12/2021 Credit Risk Assessment of Personal Loans Using Non-Parametric Survival
Models
A Case Study of Kenyan Banks
This research study explores the application of survival analysis in credit risk
modeling and credit scoring algorithms for banks in Kenya. The study highlights the
significance of dynamic credit status and the estimation of time to default, aiming
to assist banks in identifying key variables influencing default, determining worstcase default rates, and estimating the required capital for risk mitigation. The study
utilizes non-parametric models, such as Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen, to fit rightcensored data and estimate the probability of default. The findings emphasize the
importance of considering censored data and suggest the inclusion of
macroeconomic factors in credit risk analysis. The research provides valuable
insights into credit risk management and can serve as a basis for further studies in
diverse credit risk projects in Kenya.
